# Newsspec-6762

VJ project


## Getting started

Set up the project

```
grunt
```

There are no responsive images (images are loaded via CSS and are adaptive)

There is no World Service version


## Generate the content

Text content is generated by running perl scripts over a tab delimited text file (which must be saved in Windows format).

The perl scripts and data sheet are located here:
https://github.com/BBCVisualJournalism/newsspec_6762/tree/data/j_inc_scripts

**inc_maker_hillsborough.pl**              - generates HTML with calls to j_inc files

**inc_maker_hillsborough_j_incs.pl**       - generates the j_inc files

**inc_maker_hillsborough_text_editor.pl**   - generates marked up SSI_EDITOR links for the j_inc files


**Important!**  Running *inc_maker_hillsborough.pl* outputs markup to an include file, *output/hillsborough.inc*. This markup must then be copied into the main HTML file of the project and you must do a little manual work here:

Run grunt to create the usual output including *index.html*

Run ```grunt stage``` then run ```grunt live```

In the main project folder on nolmcs01, change *index.html* to *index.stm*.

Edit *index.inc* (line 37) to point at *index.stm* instead of *index.html*.

In *index.stm*, replace the ul tag with id 'ns__hillsborough__list' and all of its content with the markup in the include *output/hillsborough.inc*.

Check preview and deploy to live using the FTP script as normal.

## Gotchas

The spreadsheet will often contain non-standard characters and these will need to be replaced by characters which will render correctly in a web browser. Here's a list of common problem characters and what they need to be changed to.

‘	->	'
’	->	'
""	->	&quot;
“	-> &quot;
”	-> &quot;
. "	->	."
.  "	->	."
…	->	...
