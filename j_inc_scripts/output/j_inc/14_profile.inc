Steven Brown, as he was known, was a machine operator from Wrexham and a Liverpool FC season ticket holder. He went to Hillsborough with his brother, Andrew Brown, who survived. He met his wife, Sarah when he was just 16:  she was six months pregnant when he died. Their daughter was called Samantha, a name Steven chose. &quot;I have tried to shower her with her daddy's love, which I know would have flown in abundance,&quot; Sarah told the inquest.
