Paula Smith from Clubmoor, Liverpool travelled alone to Sheffield on a Liverpool Supporters' Club coach. Her brother Walter said their parents were overjoyed when she was born as they only had sons and she was &quot;absolutely loved and spoilt by all of us.&quot; They used to go to matches together but only had one ticket to the semi-final at Hillsborough and Walter let Paula take it. &quot;I often think if I'd been there with her she would be alive today.&quot;
