Roy, as he was known to family and friends, studied computer programming at Leicester Polytechnic. He travelled to Sheffield by coach with his father William Ewart Pemberton, who did not attend the match but went along to keep his son company. Roy suffered from type 1 diabetes from a young age and had to inject insulin &quot;but never moaned&quot;. His parents had previously lost another son and Roy was the &quot;apple of their eye&quot;.
