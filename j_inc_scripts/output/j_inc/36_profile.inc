A nurse and father-of-two from Liverpool, Eric Hankin travelled with a number of friends, who all survived. He married his wife when she was 16 and he was 20. He was &quot;dedicated&quot; to his job as a staff nurse at Moss Side Hospital in Maghull, Liverpool. His daughter Lynsey, told the inquest, when she was growing up, her dad was like a &quot;big friendly giant&quot; who made everyone laugh. &quot;There's a big, giant-shaped hole in my heart since he died. I've learned to live with it, but I don't think the pain will ever leave.&quot;
