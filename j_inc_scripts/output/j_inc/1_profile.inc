Known as Jack, Mr Anderson was a married security officer from Liverpool. He travelled to Sheffield by car with his son, Brian, and two friends, all of whom survived. Jack was a loving grandfather, Brian told the inquest, and had started taking his grandson Graeme to the match. &quot;My dad would sit him on the wall in the Kop, just in front of him, Graeme having a great time, just like I did when I was a small child.&quot; His mum had been deprived of her later years with her husband, he added. &quot;Dad is greatly missed by all of us.&quot;
