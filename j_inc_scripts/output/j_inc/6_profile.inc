A YTS trainee from Liverpool, Simon Bell travelled with his friend Danny Murphy and his father, Alan, who both survived. Simon's father Christopher said he was &quot;obsessed with cricket&quot; and played for Lancashire schoolboys.&quot; Mr Bell said it &quot;would have been great to see what he would have become&quot;. He met up with other friends, including <a class="ns__hillsborough__link--companion" href="#ns__hillsborough--25">Christopher Devonside</a> and <a class="ns__hillsborough__link--companion" href="#ns__hillsborough--18">Gary Church</a>, both of whom died in the tragedy.
