A draughtsman from Liverpool, Nick Joynes, as he was known, travelled to the match with a number of friends, who all survived except <a class="ns__hillsborough__link--companion" href="#ns__hillsborough--61">Francis McAllister</a>. Nick was a talented footballer who played for Bootle Boys and even had trials with Liverpool. He married his wife Gillian the September before the disaster. Tragically, his brother Mark was also killed in an accident in South Africa in 1983. Speaking at the inquests, his brother James said Nick's death &quot;has left a massive void in our family, and we miss him dearly.&quot;
