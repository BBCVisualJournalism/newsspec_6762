Francis McAllister was a fireman, originally from Liverpool, but working in London, and a good enough footballer to make the brigade's national side. He travelled on his own to Sheffield but met friends, all of whom survived except <a class="ns__hillsborough__link--companion" href="#ns__hillsborough--55">Nicholas Peter Joynes</a>. As a boy, Francis was saved from a boating lake accident in North Wales by his father, Francis Andrew McAllister. His brother, Mark, said: &quot;Our father died nine years after Hillsborough, always regretting he had not been on hand to save his son one more time.&quot;
