Rick, as he was known, had a chemistry degree from Sheffield University and drove to Hillsborough with his sister Stephanie Jones, who survived, and his 23-year-old girlfriend, <a class="ns__hillsborough__link--companion" href="#ns__hillsborough--23">Tracey Cox</a>, who also died in the tragedy. Rick was interested in the environment and a big Liverpool fan. &quot;My life is centred on what Rick and Tracey have missed and what our lives would be like now,&quot; said Doreen Jones, Richard's mother. &quot;After all, they only went to watch a football game.&quot;
