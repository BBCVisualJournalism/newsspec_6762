Kevin Traynor, as he was known to his family and friends, was an apprentice joiner from Birkenhead. He travelled with his brother <a class="ns__hillsborough__link--companion" href="#ns__hillsborough--88">Christopher John Traynor</a> and friend <a class="ns__hillsborough__link--companion" href="#ns__hillsborough--83">Dave Thomas</a>, who both also died. The youngest of five children, Kevin enjoyed keeping fit and was a promising boxer. Kevin had also been in the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough for the 1988 semi-final the year earlier.  &quot;When he heard the 1989 game would be there, he said: 'Oh, no, not that stadium again!' &quot; the inquest was told.
