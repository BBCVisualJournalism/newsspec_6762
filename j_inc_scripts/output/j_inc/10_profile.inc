The 96th and final person to die after Hillsborough, Tony Bland was a labourer from Keighley, West Yorkshire, who travelled by car with friends, Ian Grew and Alan Gill, who both survived. He spent nearly four years in a persistent vegetative state before his death on 3 March 1993. In a landmark case, judges ruled he should be allowed to die through the withdrawal of feeding tubes.
