A junior clerk from Warrington, Ian Whelan travelled to the match on a Liverpool supporters' coach from Anfield. He was nicknamed 'Ronnie' after his football hero, the Liverpool player Ronnie Whelan. Ian used to draw caricatures of the Liverpool players before sending them off to be signed. Before leaving that morning, Ian left two red roses on his girlfriend Joanne's doorstep, because he didn't want to wake her.
