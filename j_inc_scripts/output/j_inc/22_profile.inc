Gary Collins was a quality controller at a food factory from Liverpool, who drove to the match with friends Martin Malone and Henry Clarke, both of whom survived. He came from a family of Evertonians, but was a big Liverpool fan. &quot;To think that the Hillsborough disaster could have been prevented is excruciating to live with,&quot; his father, John, told the inquest. &quot;The fact we will never see Gary reach his full potential in life is the cruellest thing this life has ever dealt us.&quot;
