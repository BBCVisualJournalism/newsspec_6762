A senior radiographer and Sunday school teacher from Preston, Christine Jones travelled to Hillsborough with her husband Stephen Jones who survived the tragedy. They had been married for four years when she died. A big music fan, she loved New Order and The Smiths and became a vegetarian after hearing the Smiths track 'Meat is Murder.' Christine enjoyed the atmosphere at Liverpool games and took an active part in organising coach travel to matches.
