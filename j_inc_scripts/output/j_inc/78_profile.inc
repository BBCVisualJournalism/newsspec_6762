Chester schoolboy Henry Rogers travelled with his older brother Adam and other friends, who all survived. The middle of three children, he loved sport using his little sister Alex, &quot;as a goalpost as she sat in her pushchair&quot;, his mother Veronica told the inquest. &quot;Straightforward, easy-going and charming... he was a natural person and a charmer&quot;. A good student, Henry was hoping to study economics at university when he died. His brother Adam died a few months after Henry in tragic circumstances unrelated to Hillsborough.
