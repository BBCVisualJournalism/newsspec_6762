A railway guard from Liverpool, Pat Thompson had five children under six years when he died. A passionate Liverpool supporter, he changed his shift to go to the game, travelling by train with his two brothers, Kevin and Joe, who survived. He was described by his widow, Kathleen Thompson, as &quot;a smashing dad&quot; and &quot;a loving and generous man&quot;. &quot;Pat was not a hooligan, but a hard-working family man,&quot; she said.
